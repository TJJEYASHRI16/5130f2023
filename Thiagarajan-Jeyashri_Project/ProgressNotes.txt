We've covered the fundamental steps of building a web page using Node.js and the Express framework, and we've established the basic user interface. Using EJS, Node.js, and Express, we've incorporated a few internal links into our webpage. We've relied on HTML and CSS for styling. Our next significant milestone is to enhance functionality and establish a connection with a database, which will be a critical part of our project's progress.

I take pride in acquiring knowledge about a new concept known as EJS (Embedded JavaScript). I've successfully established a structural foundation for my website, 
incorporating a consistent navigation bar in the header and designing a footer.
This uniform design element is maintained across all the pages, ensuring a cohesive and professional look throughout the site.
