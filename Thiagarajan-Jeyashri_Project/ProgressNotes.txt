We've covered the fundamental steps of building a web page using Node.js and the Express framework, and we've established the basic user interface. Using EJS, Node.js, and Express, we've incorporated a few internal links into our webpage. We've relied on HTML and CSS for styling. Our next significant milestone is to enhance functionality and establish a connection with a database, which will be a critical part of our project's progress.

We have developed a comprehensive user management system that includes functionalities for creating, retrieving, and displaying user details. Additionally, We have implemented a category system, allowing users to be associated with specific categories. Now, We are planning to extend the system by introducing a new table that enables users to monitor and track their habits.

This week, our focus is on enhancing the user interface of the calendar and incorporating a new feature that integrates activities with the calendar page. Following that, our upcoming task involves developing an object-relational mapping for activities and implementing storage in the database.

CREATE TABLE activities (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,

);

CREATE TABLE user_activity (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES useracc(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
